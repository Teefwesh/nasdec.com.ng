        Home work is a reinforcement of all taught concepts. Home work is sent
        thrice in a week; Monday, Wednesday and Friday and it includes
        activities such as soft activities, reading, writing, craft and

        The Learning focus (which is a guide that has information about the
        homework) will always be put in the child’s Home-work Journal and we
        encourage parents not to do their children’s homework but go over it
        with the child and give feedback to the teachers on how well they
        perform.
