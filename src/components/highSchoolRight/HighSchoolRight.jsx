        Nasdec Royal School offers a broad and balanced curriculum based on the
        National Curriculum of Nigeria. It offers a wide variety of academic
        subjects taught by a dedicated and professional staff. <br />
        The Senior School Students have a choice to specialize in any of the
        three major areas of study offered, namely;
      </p>
      <ol className="learningList">
        <li>Sciences</li>
        <li>Art</li>
        <li>Commercial</li>
      </ol>

      <br />

      <p>
        However, despite their area of specialization, they have a list of
        Compulsory subjects:
      </p>
      <ul className="learningList">
        <li>English Language</li>
        <li>Mathematics</li>
        <li>Biology</li>

      <p>
        We provide opportunities for students to study the broadest possible
        range of subjects and to acquire a variety of important practical and
        academic skills.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Extra-Curricula Activities</h2>
      <p>
        We recognize strong academic performance alone is not enough. Which is
        why we invest in extra-curricula activities that help our students to
        develop and stimulate creativity, build confidence, learn life skills
        and create social awareness.
      </p>

      <p>Activities include dance, drama, computer, chess and music.</p>

      <br />

      <h2>School Trips/ Excursion</h2>
      <p>
        Student tours and excursions are also part of the Nasdec Royal Schools
        experience.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Arts and Culture</h2>
      <p>
        Along with our excellent selection of clubs, sporting opportunities and
        organized day trips, we also encourage an appreciation of the Arts.
        Students are expected to engage in cultural activities during each
        academic term, with stimulating drama productions at special
        celebrations throughout the year.
