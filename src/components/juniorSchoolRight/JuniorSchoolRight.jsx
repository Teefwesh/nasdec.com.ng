        Nasdec Royal Schools runs the Junior Secondary School and Senior
        Secondary School Programmes as specified in the Nigerian National Policy
        on Education. It offers a wide variety of academic subjects taught by a
        dedicated and professional staff. The student begins with a broad
        spectrum of subjects, which becomes more focused as he or she
        progresses.

        In the Junior Secondary School (Basic 7 to 9), the College emphasizes
        the basic skills in the following subjects:

      <h1>AGE CONSIDERATION</h1>
      <p>
        Nasdec Royal Schools does not recommend that children should enter Class
        One before their tenth birthday. If they do, they will be tempted to
        enter university before their sixteenth birthday.
      </p>
      <p>
        We feel that the best time to come to secondary school is at the
        threshold of adolescence, especially when it involves leaving home to
        enter a school boarding house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nasdec Royal Schools programme is not structured for caring for the
        needs of very young children who are still emotionally dependent on the
        close support of their parents. Our preferred age at entry would be 11
        or near it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However gifted a child may be, he or she should have completed a full
        primary school education before coming to Nasdec Royal Schools.
      </p>
      <p>
        The structure of the educational system in Nigeria reflects this and if
        children are rushed through the early stages, part of the intention and
        vision of the National Policy on Education is being defeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Education at Nasdec Royal Schools aims to encourage leadership qualities
        in all students and to encourage responsible decision-making and
        independence of thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        We feel that we are not going to get very far with either of these aims
        if children leave school when they are barely 16.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way of developing leaders in a boarding school is through the
        prefect system, and, indeed, as the school gets larger we need mature
        prefects for the efficient running of the boarding houses.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that we need senior students who are young men and women,
        rather than children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children who embark on a secondary school course too young are not
        usually chosen as leaders and as a result miss the opportunity to
        develop their full potential.
