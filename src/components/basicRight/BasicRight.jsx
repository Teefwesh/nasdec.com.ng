      <h1>HEALTHY EATING</h1>
      <p>
        <span style={{ color: "red" }}>Lunch:</span> Parents are required to
        provide students with packed lunches. Nasdec Royal Schools encourages
        healthy eating as we are conscious that a child’s diet affects their
        educational and physical growth. Consequently, where required, we are
        happy to provide advice to parents on nutritionally balanced meals for
        students.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1> EXTRA-CURRICULA ACTIVITIES</h1>
      <p>
        To enrich all of our student’s education and to develop team-building,
        fitness and friendships, after-school clubs are encouraged at Nasdec
        Royal Schools. We offer special tutors for Taekwondo, Gymnastics, Dance,
        Graphics Technology, Football and Chess at a nominal fee.

      <h1>PARENTS AS PARTNERS</h1>
      <p>
        At Nasdec Royal Schools we have a long tradition of working in
        partnership with parents for the benefit of their children. We
        understand parents need to believe that their children’s learning needs
        are been met. As a result, prospective parents and their children are
        encouraged to visit the school -and observe our student’s work. Homework
        is set on a regular basis and parents are encouraged to take an active
        interest in the projects their children are working on.
